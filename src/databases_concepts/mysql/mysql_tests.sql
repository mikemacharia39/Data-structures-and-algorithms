# There is a table courses with columns: student and class,
# list out all classes which have more than or equal to 5 students.
# The students should not be counted duplicate in each course.
For example, the table:

+---------+------------+
| student | class      |
+---------+------------+
| A       | Math       |
| B       | English    |
| C       | Math       |
| E       | Math       |
| G       | Math       |
| H       | Math       |
| I       | Math       |
+---------+------------+

# Should output:

+---------+
| class   |
+---------+
| Math    |
+---------+
