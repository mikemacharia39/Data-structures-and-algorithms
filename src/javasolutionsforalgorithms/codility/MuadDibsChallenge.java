 *
 * You want to buy public transport tickets for some upcoming days.
 * You know exactly the days on which you will be traveling. There are three types of ticket:
 *
 * 1-day ticket, costs 2, valid for one day;
 * 7-day ticket, costs 7, valid for seven consecutive days (e.g. if the first valid day is X, then the last valid day is X+6);
 * 30-day ticket, costs 25, valid for thirty consecutive days.
 * You want to pay as little as possible having valid tickets on your travelling days.
 *
 * You are given a sorted (in increasing order) array A of days when you will be traveling. For example, given:
 *
 *     A[0] = 1
 *     A[1] = 2
 *     A[2] = 4
 *     A[3] = 5
 *     A[4] = 7
 *     A[5] = 29
 *     A[6] = 30
 * you can buy one 7-day ticket and two 1-day tickets. The two 1-day tickets should be used on days 29 and 30.
 * The 7-day ticket should be used on the first seven days. The total cost is 11 and there is no possible way of paying less.
 *
 * Write a function:
 *
 * class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }
 *
 * that, given an array A consisting of N integers that specifies days on which you will be traveling,
 * returns the minimum amount of money that you have to spend on tickets.
 *
 * For example, given the above data, the function should return 11, as explained above.
 *
 * Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
 *
 * M is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
 * each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..M];
 * N is an integer within the range [1..M];
 * array A is sorted in increasing order;
 * the elements of A are all distinct.
