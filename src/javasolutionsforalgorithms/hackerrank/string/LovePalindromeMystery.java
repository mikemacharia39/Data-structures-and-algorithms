/**
 * James found a love letter that his friend Harry has written to his girlfriend.
 * James is a prankster, so he decides to meddle with the letter. He changes all the words in the letter into palindromes.
 *
 * To do this, he follows two rules:
 *
 * He can only reduce the value of a letter by , i.e. he can change d to c, but he cannot change c to d or d to b.
 * The letter  may not be reduced any further.
 * Each reduction in the value of any letter is counted as a single operation.
 * Find the minimum number of operations required to convert a given string into a palindrome.
 *
 * Example
 * cde
 *
 * Example 1: For the first query, abc → abb → aba  = 2
 * Example 2: abcba is already a palindromic string.
 * Example 3: abcd → abcc → abcb → abca → abba      = 4
 * Example 4: For the fourth query, cba → bba → aba.
 *
 * The following two operations are performed: cde → cdd → cdc. Return 2.
