/**
 * We consider two strings to be anagrams of each other if the first string's letters can be rearranged to form the second
 * string. In other words, both strings must contain the same exact letters in the same exact frequency.
 * For example, bacdc and dcbac are anagrams, but bacdc and dcbad are not.
 *
 * Alice is taking a cryptography class and finding anagrams to be very useful.
 * She decides on an encryption scheme involving two large strings where encryption is dependent on the minimum number of
 * character deletions required to make the two strings anagrams. Can you help her find this number?
 *
 * Given two strings, s1 and s2, that may not be of the same length, determine the minimum number of character deletions
 * required to make s1 and s2 anagrams. Any characters can be deleted from either of the strings.
 *
 * Sample Input:
 *
 * s1: cde
 * s2: abc
 *
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation
 *
 * Delete the following characters from our two strings to turn them into anagrams:
 *
 * Remove d and e from cde to get c.
 * Remove a and b from abc to get c.
