/**
 * A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. Each of the words consists of only uppercase and lowercase English letters (no punctuation).
 *
 * For example, "Hello World", "HELLO", and "hello world hello world" are all sentences.
 * You are given a sentence s and an integer k. You want to truncate s,
 * such that it contains only the first k words. Return s after truncating it.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: s = "Hello how are you Contestant", k = 4
 * Output: "Hello how are you"
 * Explanation:
 * The words in s are ["Hello", "how" "are", "you", "Contestant"].
 * The first 4 words are ["Hello", "how", "are", "you"].
 * Hence, you should return "Hello how are you".
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: s = "What is the solution to this problem", k = 4
 * Output: "What is the solution"
 * Explanation:
 * The words in s are ["What", "is" "the", "solution", "to", "this", "problem"].
 * The first 4 words are ["What", "is", "the", "solution"].
 * Hence, you should return "What is the solution".
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: s = "chopper is not a tanuki", k = 5
 * Output: "chopper is not a tanuki"
 *
