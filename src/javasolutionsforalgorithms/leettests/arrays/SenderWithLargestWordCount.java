/**
 * You have a chat log of n messages.
 * You are given two string arrays messages and senders where messages[i] is a message sent by senders[i].
 *
 * A message is list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces.
 * The word count of a sender is the total number of words sent by the sender.
 * Note that a sender may send more than one message.
 *
 * Return the sender with the largest word count.
 * If there is more than one sender with the largest word count, return the one with the lexicographically largest name.
 *
 * Note:
 * Uppercase letters come before lowercase letters in lexicographical order.
 * "Alice" and "alice" are distinct.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: messages = ["How is leetcode for everyone","Leetcode is useful for practice"], senders = ["Bob","Charlie"]
 * Output: "Charlie"
 * Explanation: Bob sends a total of 5 words.
 * Charlie sends a total of 5 words.
 * Since there is a tie for the largest word count, we return the sender with the lexicographically larger name, Charlie.
