/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/
 *
 * Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.
 *
 * There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously
 * following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer
 * is connected to (0-indexed). It is -1 if there is no cycle. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.
 *
 * Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
 *
 *  3 -> 2 -> 0 -> -4
 *       ^          |
 *       |__________|
 *
 * Output: tail connects to node index 1
 * Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
