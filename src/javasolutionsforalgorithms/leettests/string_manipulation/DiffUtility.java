 * Interview Problem: Diff Utility
 * The diff utility is a data comparison tool that calculates and displays the differences between the two texts.
 * It tries to determine the smallest set of deletions and insertions to create one text from the other.
 * Diff is line-oriented rather than character-oriented, unlike edit distance.
 *
 *
 * Test Case 1:
 *
 * Input: X = "XMJYAUZ", Y = "XMJAATZ"
 * Output: [X, M, J, -Y, A, -U, +A, +T, Z]
 *
 * Test Case 2:
 * Input: X = "ABCDFGHJQZ", Y = "ABCDEFGIJKRXYZ"
 * Output: [A, B, C, D, +E, F, G, -H, +I, J, -Q, +K, +R, +X, +Y, Z]
