/**
 * <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-swaps-to-make-the-string-balanced/">...</a>
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: s = "][]["
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: You can make the string balanced by swapping index 0 with index 3.
 * The resulting string is "[[]]".
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: s = "]]][[["
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: You can do the following to make the string balanced:
 * - Swap index 0 with index 4. s = "[]][][".
 * - Swap index 1 with index 5. s = "[[][]]".
 * The resulting string is "[[][]]".
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: s = "[]"
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: The string is already balanced.
