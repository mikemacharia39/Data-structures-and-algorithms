/**
 * Given a pointer to the root of a binary tree, you need to print the level order traversal of this tree.
 * In level-order traversal, nodes are visited level by level from left to right.
 * Complete the function levelOrder and print the values in a single line separated by a space.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 *      1
 *       \
 *        2
 *         \
 *          5
 *         /  \
 *        3    6
 *         \
 *          4
 * For the above tree, the level order traversal is 1 -> 2 -> 5 -> 3 -> 6 -> 4.
 *
 * Input Format
 *
 * You are given a function,
 *
 * void levelOrder(Node * root) {
 *
 * }
 *
