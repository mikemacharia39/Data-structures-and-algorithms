 * Animesh has n empty candy jars, numbered from 1 to n, with infinite capacity.
 * He performs m operations. Each operation is described by  integers, a, b, and k.
 * Here, a and b are indices of the jars, and k is the number of candies to be added inside each jar whose index lies
 * between a and b (both inclusive). Can you tell the average number of candies after m operations?
