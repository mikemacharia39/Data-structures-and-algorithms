/**
 * Given an array of integers, determine the minimum number of elements to delete to leave only elements of equal value.
 *
 * Example
 * arr = {1,2,2,3}
 *
 * Delete the 2 elements 1 and 3 leaving arr = [2,2].
 * If both twos plus either the 1 or the 3 are deleted, it takes 2 deletions to leave either 3 or 1.
 * The minimum number of deletions is 2.
 *
 * Sample Input
 *
 * STDIN       Function
 * -----       --------
 * 3 3 2 1 3   arr = [3, 3, 2, 1, 3]
 *
 * Sample Output = 2, because we deleted 2,1 and the arr = [3,3,3]
