 *
 * There is a large pile of socks that must be paired by color. Given an array of integers representing the color of each sock,
 * determine how many pairs of socks with matching colors there are.
 *
 * Example
 * n = 7
 * ar = [1,2,1,2,1,3,2]
 * There is one pair of 1 and one of 2. There are three odd socks left, one of each color. The number of pairs is 2.
