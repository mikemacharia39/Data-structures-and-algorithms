 * Sorting is useful as the first step in many different tasks.
 * The most common task is to make finding things easier, but there are other uses as well.
 * In this case, it will make it easier to determine which pair or pairs of elements have the smallest absolute
 * difference between them.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * arr = [-20, -3916237, -357920, -3620601, 7374819, -7330761, 30, 6246457, -6461594, 266854]
 *
 * answer = [-20, 30]
 *
 * Example 2:
 * arr = [3, 2, 1, 5, 4]
 *
 * answer = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]
