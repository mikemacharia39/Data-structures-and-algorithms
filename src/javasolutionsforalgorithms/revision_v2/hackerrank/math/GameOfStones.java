/**
 * Two players called p1 and p2 are playing a game with a starting number of stones.
 * Player p1 always plays first, and the two players move in alternating turns. The game's rules are as follows:
 *
 * In a single move, a player can remove either 2, 3, or 5 stones from the game board.
 * If a player is unable to make a move, that player loses the game.
 * Given the starting number of stones, find and print the name of the winner. p1 is named First and p2 is named Second.
 * Each player plays optimally, meaning they will not make a move that causes them to lose the game if a winning move exists.
 *
 * For example, if n=4, p1 can make the following moves:
 *
 * p1 removes 2 stones leaving 2. P2 will then remove 2 stones and win.
 * p1 removes 3 stones leaving 1. p2 cannot move and loses.
 * p1 would make the second play and win the game.
 *
