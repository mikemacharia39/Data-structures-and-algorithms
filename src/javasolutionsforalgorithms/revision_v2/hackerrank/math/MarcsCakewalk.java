 * Marc loves cupcakes, but he also likes to stay fit. Each cupcake has a calorie count,
 * and Marc can walk a distance to expend those calories.
 * If Marc has eaten  cupcakes so far, after eating a cupcake with c calories he must walk at least 2^j * c miles to maintain his weight.
 *
 * Example:
 * calories = [5, 10, 7]
 * answer = 44, because the minimum miles he must walk is 2^0 * 10 + 2^1 * 7 + 2^2 * 5 = 44
