/**
 * The distance between two array values is the number of indices between them.
 * Given an array, find the minimum distance between any pair of equal elements in the array. If no such value exists, return -1.
 *
 * Example:
 * arr = [3, 2, 1, 2, 3]
 * answer = 2, because the minimum distance between 2 and 2 is 2
