/**
 * Sherlock Holmes suspects his archenemy Professor Moriarty is once again plotting something diabolical.
 * Sherlock's companion, Dr. Watson, suggests Moriarty may be responsible for MI6's recent issues with their supercomputer,
 * The Beast.
 *
 * Shortly after resolving to investigate, Sherlock receives a note from Moriarty boasting about infecting
 * The Beast with a virus. He also gives him a clue: an integer.
 * Sherlock determines the key to removing the virus is to find the largest Decent Number having that number of digits.
 *
 * A Decent Number has the following properties:
 *
 * Its digits can only be 3's and/or 5's.
 * The number of 3's it contains is divisible by 5.
 * The number of 5's it contains is divisible by 3.
 * It is the largest such number for its length.
 * Moriarty's virus shows a clock counting down to The Beast's destruction, and time is running out fast.
 * Your task is to help Sherlock find the key before The Beast is destroyed!
