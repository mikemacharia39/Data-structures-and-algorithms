/**
 * A semaphore controls access to a shared resource through the use of a counter.
 * If the counter is greater than zero, then access is allowed. If it is zero, then access is denied.
 * What the counter is counting are permits that allow access to the shared resource.
 * Thus, to access the resource, a thread must be granted a permit from the semaphore.
 *
 * Working of semaphore
 *
 * In general, to use a semaphore, the thread that wants access to the shared resource tries to acquire a permit.
 *
 * If the semaphore’s count is greater than zero, then the thread acquires a permit, which causes the semaphore’s
 * count to be decremented.
 * Otherwise, the thread will be blocked until a permit can be acquired.
 * When the thread no longer needs an access to the shared resource, it releases the permit,
 * which causes the semaphore’s count to be incremented.
 * If there is another thread waiting for a permit, then that thread will acquire a permit at that time.
