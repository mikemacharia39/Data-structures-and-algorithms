# Indices

An index is used to quickly locate documents in a collection. Without an index, MongoDB must scan every document in a collection to 
select those documents that match the query statement. 
If an appropriate index exists for a query, MongoDB can use the index to limit the number of documents it must inspect.

It is important to carefully use indices because they can slow down write operations. 
When you create an index on a field, MongoDB creates a data structure that stores a small portion of the field's value and a 
reference to the document that contains the value.

## Analysing stats when finding data

````
db.students.find({name: "Mike"}).explain("executionStats")
{
  explainVersion: '1',
  queryPlanner: {
    namespace: 'school.students',
    indexFilterSet: false,
    parsedQuery: { name: { '$eq': 'Mike' } },
    queryHash: 'A2F868FD',
    planCacheKey: 'A2F868FD',
    maxIndexedOrSolutionsReached: false,   
    .....
    executionStats: {
    executionSuccess: true,
    nReturned: 1,
    executionTimeMillis: 0,
    totalKeysExamined: 0,
    totalDocsExamined: 10, <----------------- As you can see we examined 10 documents to find the document with the name Mike
    .....
}
````

## Creating an index

Creating an index on a field in a collection is done using the `createIndex()` method. You can choose to create a single field index or a compound index.
In the case below, we created an index on the `name` field in the order of ascending.
````
db.students.createIndex({name: 1})

name_1
````

Let's examine the stats after creating the index
````
db.students.find({name: "Mike"}).explain("executionStats")
{
  explainVersion: '1',
  queryPlanner: {
    namespace: 'school.students',
    indexFilterSet: false,
    parsedQuery: { name: { '$eq': 'Mike' } },        
    queryHash: 'A2F868FD',
    planCacheKey: 'A3E454E0',
    maxIndexedOrSolutionsReached: false,
    maxIndexedAndSolutionsReached: false,
    maxScansToExplodeReached: false,
    .....
  executionStats: {
    executionSuccess: true,
    nReturned: 1,
    executionTimeMillis: 10,  <----------------- As you can see the execution time is 10ms
    totalKeysExamined: 1,
    totalDocsExamined: 1, <----------------- As you can see we examined only 1 document to find the document with the name Mike
    executionStages: {
      stage: 'FETCH',
      nReturned: 1,
      executionTimeMillisEstimate: 11,
}
