# Create and Drop MongoDB Database

## Create a Database

````
use <database-name>;
````

The use command does not create anything until we insert the first record. Below is an example of the insert command. \n 
In this example, we are inserting a task into the tasks collection.

## How is a database created in MongoDB?
A MongoDB database is created when the first document is inserted into a collection.

````
use todo

db.tasks.insertOne({
    name: "Learn Chapter 1",
});
````
The insertOne command creates the tasks collection and inserts the task into the collection. \n

The below command verifies the database creation. It returns the names and sizes of all the databases.

````
show databases; // OR you can use the "show dbs" command
---------------------------------
admin     41 kB
config  12.3 kB
local     41 kB
todo    8.19 kB
````

Weâ€™ll observe some databases other than todo. When we install MongoDb, it installs these databases by default, and uses it for user management and system purpose.

## How is a database dropped in mongodb?

````
use todo
db.dropDatabase();
````
