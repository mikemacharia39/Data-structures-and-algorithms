# Managing a collection in a database

## Types of collections

### 1. Capped Collection 
A capped collection limits the size and the maximum number of documents. If a capped collection reaches the maximum size or maximum number of documents, the older documents are removed. We require three additional options to create a capped collection, as listed below:
  - capped (boolean): We set this value to true to create a capped collection
  - size: Maximum size in bytes
  - max: Maximum number of documents

Properties of a capped collections: 
  - Fixed size collection
  - Maximum number of documents
  - Maximum size of the collection
  - When the collection reaches the maximum size, the oldest documents are removed
  - Useful for logging, cache, etc.
  - The order of the documents is maintained
  - The insertion order is maintained

Below is an example of creating a capped collection:
````
db.createCollection("log", {
    capped : true, 
    size : 5242880, 
    max : 50000
});
````
Older logs are often not relevant. In such cases, we use the capped collection to rotate logs. Therefore, we add new logs and remove the older ones.

### 2.  Time series collection
A timeseries collection efficiently stores sequences of measurements over a period of time. 
Compared to normal collections, it improves query efficiency and reduces the disk usage for time series data. 
Only MongoDB 5.0 or newer versions support time series collection.

Below is an example of creating a time series collection:
````
db.createCollection(
   "alarms",
   {
       timeseries: {
          timeField: "timestamp",
          metaField: "data",
          granularity: "hours"
       },
       expireAfterSeconds: 2592000
   }
);
````

The syntax of a time series collection is explained below:

- *timeseries.timeField*: It’s a required field that contains a date.
- *timeseries.metaField*: It’s an optional field that consists of key-value pairs, which describe the time series data.
- *timeseries.granularity*: It’s an optional field. We set it to the unit that is closest to the rate of ingestion for a unique metaField value. This field supports seconds, minutes, and hours. The default value is seconds.
- *timeseries.expireAfterSeconds*: It’s an optional field. The documents older than provided expireAfterSeconds will be removed from the collection. As time series data often grows at a very high rate, it’s better to define this field as per need.

Inserting measurements into a time series collection:
````
db.weather.insertMany( [
   {
      "metadata": { "sensorId": 5578, "type": "temperature" },
      "timestamp": ISODate("2021-05-18T00:00:00.000Z"),
      "temp": 12
   },
   {
      "metadata": { "sensorId": 5578, "type": "temperature" },
      "timestamp": ISODate("2021-05-18T04:00:00.000Z"),
      "temp": 11
   },
   {
      "metadata": { "sensorId": 5578, "type": "temperature" },
      "timestamp": ISODate("2021-05-18T08:00:00.000Z"),
      "temp": 11
   },
   {
      "metadata": { "sensorId": 5578, "type": "temperature" },
      "timestamp": ISODate("2021-05-18T12:00:00.000Z"),
      "temp": 12
   }
]
````

Query a time series collection:
````
db.weather.findOne({
   "timestamp": ISODate("2021-05-18T00:00:00.000Z")
})
````


## Adding a Collection

````
use school
db.students.insertOne({
    name: "John",
    age: 30,
    subjects: ["Math", "Science"]
})
````

## Add another collection with options

````
use school

db.createCollection("teachers", {
    capped: true,            // This is a capped collection
    size: 10000,             // Maximum size of the collection in bytes, this is 10KB
    max: 100                 // Maximum number of documents in the collection
}, {
   autoIndexId: true
}
)
````

## To view the collections in the database


## To drop collection

````
>> use school
>> db.students.drop()

true
````


````
use school
show collections
````

## Show collection structure

````
use school
db.students.find().pretty()
````

Can we see the data types of the fields in the collection? Yes
````
>> use school

>> typeof db.students.findOne().name

string

>> typeof db.students.findOne().age

number
````


## To view the documents in a collection

````
use school
db.students.find()
````

## To view one document in a collection

````
use school
db.students.findOne()
````

## To add many documents to a collection

````
use school
db.students.insertMany([
    {
        name: "Jane",
        age: 25,
        subjects: ["Math", "Business"]
    },
    {
        name: "Doe",
        age: 35,
        subjects: ["Economics", "Science"]
    }
])
