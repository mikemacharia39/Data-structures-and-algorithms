# Sorting and limiting in MongoDB

## Sorting

To find all documents
````
use school
db.students.find()
````

To sort the documents in ascending order by a specific field
````
db.students.find().sort({name:1})
````

To sort the documents in descending order by a specific field e.g. gpa
````
db.students.find().sort({gpa:-1})
````

## Limiting

To limit the amount of documents returned
````
db.students.find().limit(2)
````
The above command will return the first two documents in the collection.


We can combine the sort and limit commands
````
db.students.find().sort({gpa:-1}).limit(2)
````
The above command will return the first two documents in the collection sorted by gpa i.e. 2 students with the highest gpa.


## Finding

We may want to look for specific records i.e. db.collection.find({query}, {projection})

### Querying

db.collection.find({query})

````
db.students.find({name: "Mike"})
````
This will return only students with name "Mike"
````
[
  {
    _id: ObjectId('66070aa74d424725e69f990d'),     
    name: 'Mike',
    age: 30,
    gpa: 4
  }
]
````


Searching for records with multiple query sets
````
 db.students.find({age: 30, name:"Mike"})
````


### Projection

We may only want to return specific fields, that is where projection comes in. 

For example, return only names
````
db.students.find({}, {name: true}) // leaving the calibraces as empty, {}, just means it will return all request data and only specific fields names 
````
This return data in the following structure:
````
[
  { _id: ObjectId('660709894d424725e69f990a'), name: 'Spongebob' },
  { _id: ObjectId('66070a694d424725e69f990b'), name: 'John' },
  { _id: ObjectId('66070a704d424725e69f990c'), name: 'Jane' }
]
````
As show above you'll receive results containing _id and name field


If you want to remove the _id
````
db.students.find({}, {_id: false, name: true})
````
This return data in the following structure:
````
[
  { name: 'Spongebob' },
  { name: 'John' },
  { name: 'Jane' }
]
````
