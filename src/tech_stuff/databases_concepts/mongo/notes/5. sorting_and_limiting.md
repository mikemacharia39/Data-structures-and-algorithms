# Sorting and limiting in MongoDB

## Sorting

To find all documents
````
use school
db.students.find()
````

To sort the documents in ascending order by a specific field
````
db.students.find().sort({name:1})
````

To sort the documents in descending order by a specific field e.g. gpa
````
db.students.find().sort({gpa:-1})
````

To limit the amount of documents returned
````
db.students.find().limit(2)
````
The above command will return the first two documents in the collection.


We can combine the sort and limit commands
````
db.students.find().sort({gpa:-1}).limit(2)
````
The above command will return the first two documents in the collection sorted by gpa i.e. 2 students with the highest gpa.
