# Sorting and limiting in MongoDB

## Sorting

To find all documents
````
use school
db.students.find()
````

To sort the documents in ascending order by a specific field
````
db.students.find().sort({name:1})
````

To sort the documents in descending order by a specific field e.g. gpa
````
db.students.find().sort({gpa:-1})
````

## Limiting

To limit the amount of documents returned
````
db.students.find().limit(2)
````
The above command will return the first two documents in the collection.


We can combine the sort and limit commands
````
db.students.find().sort({gpa:-1}).limit(2)
````
The above command will return the first two documents in the collection sorted by gpa i.e. 2 students with the highest gpa.


## Finding

We may want to look for specific records i.e. db.collection.find({query, projection})

````
db.students.find({name: "Mike"})
````
This will return only students with name "Mike"
````
[
  {
    _id: ObjectId('66070aa74d424725e69f990d'),     
    name: 'Mike',
    age: 30,
    gpa: 4
  }
]
````


Searching for records with multiple query sets
````
 db.students.find({age: 30, name:"Mike"})
````
