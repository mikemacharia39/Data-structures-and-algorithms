# Deleting documents

## Deleting a single document
To delete a single document from a collection, we use the `deleteOne({filter})` method. The method takes a filter query as an argument to specify which document to delete.

````
db.students.deleteOne({name: "John"})
````
The above command deletes the first document with the name "John". And the result is:
````
{ acknowledged: true, deletedCount: 1 }
````

## Deleting multiple documents
To delete multiple documents from a collection, we use the `deleteMany({filter})` method. The method takes a filter query as an argument to specify which documents to delete.

````
db.students.deleteMany({age: 30})
````

Can we delete multiple documents with multiple conditions? Yes, we can. 
We can use the `$and` operator to specify multiple conditions.

````
db.students.deleteMany({$and: [{age: 30}, {name: "Mike"}]})
````

Can we delete many documents by names? Yes, we can.
We can use the `$in` operator to specify multiple names.

````
db.students.deleteMany({name: {$in: ["Mike", "Jane"]}})
````

## Deleting documents that contain a specific field or missing a field

### Deleting documents that contain a specific field
To delete documents that contain a specific field, we use the `$exists` operator.

Let's update one of our documents with a dateCreated field and then delete it.
````
db.students.updateOne({name: "Sarah"}, {$set: {dateCreated: new Date()}})
````

Now, we can delete all documents that contain the dateCreated field.
````
db.students.deleteMany({dateCreated: {$exists: true}})
````

### Deleting documents that are missing a field
To delete documents that are missing a specific field, we use the `$exists` operator with a value of `false`.
