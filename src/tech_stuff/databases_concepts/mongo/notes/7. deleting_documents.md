# Deleting documents

## Deleting a single document
To delete a single document from a collection, we use the `deleteOne({filter})` method. The method takes a filter query as an argument to specify which document to delete.

````
db.students.deleteOne({name: "John"})
````
The above command deletes the first document with the name "John". And the result is:
````
{ acknowledged: true, deletedCount: 1 }
````

## Deleting multiple documents
To delete multiple documents from a collection, we use the `deleteMany({filter})` method. The method takes a filter query as an argument to specify which documents to delete.

````
db.students.deleteMany({age: 30})
````

Can we delete multiple documents with multiple conditions? Yes, we can. 
We can use the `$and` operator to specify multiple conditions.

````
db.students.deleteMany({$and: [{age: 30}, {name: "Mike"}]})
````

Can we delete many documents by names? Yes, we can.
We can use the `$in` operator to specify multiple names.

````
db.students.deleteMany({name: {$in: ["Mike", "Jane"]}})
````
