# Deleting documents

## Deleting a single document
To delete a single document from a collection, we use the `deleteOne({filter})` method. The method takes a filter query as an argument to specify which document to delete.

````
db.students.deleteOne({name: "John"})
````
The above command deletes the first document with the name "John". And the result is:
````
{ acknowledged: true, deletedCount: 1 }
````
