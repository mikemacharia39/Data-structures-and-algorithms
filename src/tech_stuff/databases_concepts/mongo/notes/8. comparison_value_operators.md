- `$nin` : Not in. It is used to compare values and return documents that do not match the values.

db.students.find({name: {$nin: ["Mike", "John", "Jane"]}})
````

- `$lt` : Less than. It is used to compare values and return documents that are less than the value.

db.students.find({age: {$lt: 20}})
````
