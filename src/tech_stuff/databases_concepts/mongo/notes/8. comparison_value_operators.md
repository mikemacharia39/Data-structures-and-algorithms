# Comparison Value operators

- `$ne` : Not equal to. It is used to compare values and return documents that do not match the value.

For example, we want to get all students whose name is not equal to Mike
````
db.students.find({name: {$ne: "Mike"}})
````

- `$nin` : Not in. It is used to compare values and return documents that do not match the values.

For example, we want to get all students whose name is not in the list of names
````
db.students.find({name: {$nin: ["Mike", "John", "Jane"]}})
````

- `$lt` : Less than. It is used to compare values and return documents that are less than the value.

For example, we want to get all students whose age is less than 20
````
db.students.find({age: {$lt: 20}})
````

- `$lte` : Less than or equal to. It is used to compare values and return documents that are less than or equal to the value.

For example, we want to get all students whose age is less than or equal to 20
````
db.students.find({age: {$lte: 20}})
````

- `$gt` : Greater than. It is used to compare values and return documents that are greater than the value.

For example, we want to get all students whose age is greater than 20
````
db.students.find({age: {$gt: 20}})
````

- `$gte` : Greater than or equal to. It is used to compare values and return documents that are greater than or equal to the value.

For example, we want to get all students whose age is greater than or equal to 20
````
db.students.find({age: {$gte: 20}})
````

- `$in` : In. It is used to compare values and return documents that match the values.

To get all students whose age is 20 or 27
````
db.students.find({age: {$in: [20, 27]}})
````

- `$regex` : Regular expression. It is used to compare values and return documents that match the regular expression.

For example, we want to get all students whose name starts with 'J'
````
db.students.find({name: {$regex: "^J"}})   
[
  {
    _id: ObjectId('66070a694d424725e69f990b'),
    age: 20,
    gpa: 3.1,
    name: 'John',
    fullTime: true
  },
  {
    _id: ObjectId('66070a704d424725e69f990c'),
    age: 20,
    gpa: 3.9,
    name: 'Jane',
    fullTime: true
  }
]
````

Or We can use the `$regex` operator with the `$options` operator to specify the regular expression options. 
For example, we want to get all students whose name starts with 'J' and is case-insensitive
````
db.students.find({name: {$regex: "^J", $options: "i"}})   
[
  {
    _id: ObjectId('66070a694d424725e69f990b'),
    age: 20,
    gpa: 3.1,
    name: 'John',
    fullTime: true
  },
  {
    _id: ObjectId('66070a704d424725e69f990c'),
    age: 20,
    gpa: 3.9,
    name: 'Jane',
    fullTime: true
  }
]
````

## Using more than 1 comparison value operator e.g. `$lt` and `$gt`
For example, we want to get all students whose age is greater than 20 and less than 30
````
db.students.find({age: {$gt: 20, $lt: 30}})

[
  {
    _id: ObjectId('66070fa3bcfc2cd4fcd524f9'),     
    name: 'Frank',
    age: 27,
    gpa: 3.1,
    fullTime: true
  },
  {
    _id: ObjectId('66070fa3bcfc2cd4fcd524fa'),     
    name: 'Serah',
    age: 29,
    gpa: 2.9,
    fullTime: true
  }
]
