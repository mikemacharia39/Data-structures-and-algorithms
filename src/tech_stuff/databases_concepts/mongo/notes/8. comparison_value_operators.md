# Comparison Value operators

- `$ne` : Not equal to. It is used to compare values and return documents that do not match the value.

For example, we want to get all students whose name is not equal to Mike
````
db.students.find({name: {$ne: "Mike"}})
````

- `$nin` : Not in. It is used to compare values and return documents that do not match the values.

For example, we want to get all students whose name is not in the list of names
````
db.students.find({name: {$nin: ["Mike", "John", "Jane"]}})
````

- `$lt` : Less than. It is used to compare values and return documents that are less than the value.

For example, we want to get all students whose age is less than 20
````
db.students.find({age: {$lt: 20}})
````
