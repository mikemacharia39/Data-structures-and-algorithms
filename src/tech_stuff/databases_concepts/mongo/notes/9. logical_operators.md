# Logical Operators

These operators are used to perform logical operations on the expressions and return the result in boolean format.

- `$and` : Logical AND. It is used to combine multiple expressions and return documents that match all the expressions.

For example, we want to get all students whose age is less than or equal to 20 and gpa is greater than or equal to 3
````
db.students.find({$and: [{age: {$lte: 20}}, {gpa: {$gte: 3}}]})
[
  {
    _id: ObjectId('66070a694d424725e69f990b'),     
    age: 20,
    gpa: 3.1,
    name: 'John',
    fullTime: true
  },
  {
    _id: ObjectId('66070a704d424725e69f990c'),     
    age: 20,
    gpa: 3.9,
    name: 'Jane',
    fullTime: true
  }
]
````

- `$or` : Logical OR. It is used to combine multiple expressions and return documents that match at least one of the expressions.

For example, we want to get all students whose age is less than 20 or gpa is greater than 3
````
db.students.find({$or: [{age: {$lt: 20}}, {gpa: {$gt: 3}}]})
[
  {
    _id: ObjectId('66070a694d424725e69f990b'),     
    age: 20,
    gpa: 3.1,
    name: 'John',
    fullTime: true
  },
  {
    _id: ObjectId('660815d04d424725e69f9911'),     
    name: 'Mark',
    age: 19,
    gpa: 3.2
  }
]
````

- `$nor` : Logical NOR. It is used to combine multiple expressions and return documents that do not match any of the expressions.

For example, we want to get all students whose age is not less than 20 and gpa is not greater than 3
````
db.students.find({$nor: [{age: {$lt: 20}}, {gpa: {$gt: 3}}]})
[
  {
    _id: ObjectId('66070c0b4d424725e69f990f'),     
    name: 'Patrick',
    age: 40,
    gpa: 2.5,
    fullTime: true
  }
]
````

- `$not` : Logical NOT. It is used to negate an expression and return documents that do not match the expression.
Not can also be used to return null values in case of missing fields.

For example, we want to get all students whose age is not less than 40
````
db.students.find({age: {$not: {$lt: 40}}}) 
[
  {
    _id: ObjectId('66070c0b4d424725e69f990f'),
    name: 'Patrick',
    age: 40,
    gpa: 2.5,
    fullTime: true
  },
  {
    _id: ObjectId('66070c0b4d424725e69f9910'),
    name: 'Garry',
    age: 50,
    gpa: 2.99
  }
]
````
