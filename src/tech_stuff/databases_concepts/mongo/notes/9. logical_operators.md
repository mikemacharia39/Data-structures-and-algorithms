# Logical Operators

These operators are used to perform logical operations on the expressions and return the result in boolean format.

- `$and` : Logical AND. It is used to combine multiple expressions and return documents that match all the expressions.

For example, we want to get all students whose age is less than or equal to 20 and gpa is greater than or equal to 3
````
db.students.find({$and: [{age: {$lte: 20}}, {gpa: {$gte: 3}}]})
[
  {
    _id: ObjectId('66070a694d424725e69f990b'),     
    age: 20,
    gpa: 3.1,
    name: 'John',
    fullTime: true
  },
  {
    _id: ObjectId('66070a704d424725e69f990c'),     
    age: 20,
    gpa: 3.9,
    name: 'Jane',
    fullTime: true
  }
]
````

- `$or` : Logical OR. It is used to combine multiple expressions and return documents that match at least one of the expressions.

For example, we want to get all students whose age is less than 20 or gpa is greater than 3
````
db.students.find({$or: [{age: {$lt: 20}}, {gpa: {$gt: 3}}]})
[
  {
    _id: ObjectId('66070a694d424725e69f990b'),     
    age: 20,
    gpa: 3.1,
    name: 'John',
    fullTime: true
  },
  {
    _id: ObjectId('660815d04d424725e69f9911'),     
    name: 'Mark',
    age: 19,
    gpa: 3.2
  }
]
