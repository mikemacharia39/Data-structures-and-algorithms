# Solid principles
These are the five principles of object-oriented programming and design. They are:

1. Single Responsibility Principle
The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have
only one job or responsibility. This principle helps in making the code more modular and easier to understand.
2. Open/Closed Principle
The Open/Closed Principle states that a class should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that a class
should be designed in such a way that it can be extended to add new functionality without modifying the existing code.
3. Liskov Substitution Principle
The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without
affecting the correctness of the program. This principle helps in designing classes that are easy to extend and maintain.
4. Interface Segregation Principle
The Interface Segregation Principle states that a class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use. This principle
helps in designing classes that are more focused and have a clear purpose.
5. Dependency Inversion Principle
Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
The Dependency Inversion Principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on
abstractions. This principle helps in designing classes that are loosely coupled and easier to test and maintain.
